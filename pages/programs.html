            <p>In the PLAYer Junior Golf Group Lessons, participants ages 5-18 receive golf instruction in classes with no larger than an six-to-one student/instructor ratio. The classes meet once per week for seven weeks, 60 minutes per class, during which time the participants are taught the fundamentals, rules and etiquette of golf along with a curriculum of life skills. All classes are led by a PGA professional or other qualified golf instructor. These sessions will be offered continuously throughout the year. Students who have their own golf clubs are encouraged to bring them to class; however, for any student who does not have equipment, First Tee – Tampa Bay will provide the appropriate clubs for each session. First Tee’s PLAYer level curriculum is covered in PLAYer Group Golf Lessons.</p>

Each Junior Golf Team Member will practice their golf skills, learn the rules and etiquette of the game, and learn a First Tee Life Skill lesson prior to each match. First Tee’s Par and Birdie level curriculums are covered in “Team” Golf programs.</p>
